In this project we would focus on these given below points-
1. To know about calling of API's
2. To optimize our website for better performance
3. we would learn about component reusability which has been the actual moto of using react as a framework
4. creation of custom hooks in react

Custom hooks-
- In most cases these custom hooks return javascript so the hooks need to be named accordingly
- Hooks are nothing but functions which returns a variable and a function reference
- It is kind of standerdized rule that the for every hook name "use" prefix is always used.

API call-
- Bydefault when API is called the input we get is in form of string format so we need to convert it into a json file to properly read it for our use.
